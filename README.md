# Popcorn-Cinema
Imagine a website where you can easily find movies you'll love. Just type in the name of a movie or a genre, and it will show you a list of options. You can even see what other people think of the movies by reading reviews.  This app uses special computer magic to suggest movies you might like based on what you've watched before.
